# Spam-Email-Detetcion-System-Evaluation

In this project, we will determine the best machine-learning models for detecting spam emails. We will be comparing algorithms: ordinary least squares, lasso regression, K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression and losso logistic. To find the best learning algorithms, we are going to use bootstrap to generate confidence intervals for evaluation.
Roadmap:

1. We will start by gathering a dataset consisting of spam and non-spam emails.
2. We will extract the relevant features such as the presence of specific words, email
headers, etc. that can be used as inputs to the machine learning models.
3. We will split the dataset into a training set and a testing set and perform each algorithm
on the training set using the appropriate frameworks.
4. We will evaluate the performance of each algorithm using appropriate evaluation
metrics.
5. We will generate confidence intervals for the evaluation metrics by employing bootstrap
resampling.
6. we will use the evaluation metrics and the confidence interval to analyze the
performance of each algorithm and select the best algorithm.
